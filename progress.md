# FastFiles — Project Status

Windows-only C++20 native file manager built around a persistent NTFS index.

## Architecture

Three-process privileged/unprivileged split (rationale and decisions in
`openspec/changes/establish-architecture-foundation/design.md`):

- **FastFilesIndexSvc** — privileged Windows service (LocalSystem, constrained broker):
  stateless relay for raw MFT/USN bytes; no index, no query parsing.
- **FastFilesEngine** — unprivileged per-logon process that owns the index and the
  privileged-connection lifecycle.
- **FastFiles** — Direct2D/DirectComposition desktop shell (Column View).

## Current State

The privileged MFT/USN scan is implemented but remains fail-closed while the
authorized mutual-auth pins and live production validation are unavailable.
Degraded mode remains the active, first-class path: unprivileged tree walks and
directory watches continue to work without the service.

Dynamic release state is generated from Git, CTest, capability manifests, release
evidence, and every OpenSpec task ledger. It is never maintained as a test-count or
checkbox summary in this file.

Run `pwsh ./verify/verify.ps1 status` to generate the structured JSON source and
sanitized Markdown projection under the ignored `verify/status/generated/`
directory. `tasks.md` remains the acceptance authority for each OpenSpec change.

## Release-state interpretation

- `PASS` means the named evidence was actually observed.
- `FAIL` means an executable check ran and found a defect.
- `SKIPPED` means an optional check was not selected or has no available evidence.
- `BLOCKED_ENVIRONMENT` means a different interactive/elevated host configuration is required.
- `REQUIRED-BUT-UNAVAILABLE` means a provider, production signer, or clean-host resource is missing; it is never a certification.
